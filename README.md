# RAM_DBMS
RAM based DBMS implemented in C++


The code does not work properly. The queries entered by the user have to be parsed to execute them.
The code written works for creating tables and inserting rows into the tables when it is hardcoded.

# Current Features

### Create Table

Given tablename, number of columns and column description, the DBMS will create a table in the database with the constraints given to it.

### Insert into Table

Given a tuple and table name, it inserts the data into the table after checking for duplicate keys.
